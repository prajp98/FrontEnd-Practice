        <h1>HTML Events</h1>
        <p>An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does. <br>
            Here are some examples of HTML events: <br>
            
                An HTML web page has finished loading <br>
                An HTML input field was changed <br>
                An HTML button was clicked <br>
                JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected. <br>

                HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

        <h2>The onclick Attribute</h2>
        <button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML=Date()">The time is?</button>
        <p id="demo"></p>

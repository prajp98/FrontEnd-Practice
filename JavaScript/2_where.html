    <p id="demo1"></p>
    <script>document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML=
        "Hello World";
    </script>
    <p>In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between script tags.</p>
    <p>You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.

Scripts can be placed in the body, or in the head section of an HTML page, or in both.</p>    
        <p>Placing scripts at the bottom of the body element improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows down the display.</p>
        <h3>External JavaScript</h3>
        <p>External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.

JavaScript files have the file extension .js.

To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a script tag</p>
<p id="demo">A Paragraph.</p>

<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>

<p>This example links to "myScript.js".</p>
<p>(myFunction is stored in "myScript.js")</p>

<script src="myScript.js"></script>
<p>Placing scripts in external files has some advantages: <br>

    It separates HTML and code <br>
    It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain <br>
    Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads <br>

To add several script files to one page  - use several script tags:</p>
<p>
  An external script can be referenced in 3 different ways: <br>

    With a full URL (a full web address) <br>
    <script src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript.js"></script> 
    With a file path (like /js/) <br>
    <script src="/js/myScript.js"></script>
    Without any path <br>
    <script src="myScript.js"></script>
</p>

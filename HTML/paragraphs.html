        <p>A paragraph always starts on a new line,
         and is usually a block of text.
         <br>A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers
          automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
        <br>Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.

            With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your 
            HTML code.
            The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed 
        <br>
        The hr tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
        <hr>The hr element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:
        <br>
        The HTML br element defines a line break.
        Use br if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:
        </p>


<p>The HTML pre element defines preformatted text. The text inside a pre element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
<pre>
    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

    My Bonnie lies over the sea.

    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

    Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>

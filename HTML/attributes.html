        <h1>HTML Attributes</h1>
        <p>HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
            <br>Attributes are always specified in the start tag
            <br>Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
        </p>
        <p>The 'a' tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
        <br>
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Link to W3Schools</a></p>

        <p>The 'img' tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed</p>
        <br>
        Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website.
        <br>
        <img src="https://jenmulligandesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/pexels-beach-tropical-scene-free-stock-photo.jpg" width="300" height="200">
        <br>
        Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. 
        Here, the URL does not include the domain name. 
        <br>If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. 
        Example: src="img_girl.jpg". 
        <br>If the URL begins with a slash, 
        it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".
        <br>
        <img src="ocean.jpg" alt="Ocean image">
        <br>The 'img' tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels)
        <br>The required alt attribute for the 'img' tag specifies an alternate text
         for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. 
         This can be due to a slow connection, 
        or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.
        <p>The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.</p>
        <p style="color: chocolate;">This is a chocolate paragraph</p>
        <p>You should always include the lang attribute inside the html tag,
             to declare the language of the Web page. 
            This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.<br>
        Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. 
        So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page,
         and the last two characters define the country.</p>
        <p title="Title attribute">
            The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
            The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a
             tooltip when you mouse over the element.
